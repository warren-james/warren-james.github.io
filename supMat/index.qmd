title: "Supplementary Materials"
description: | 
  This is where I have stored all the supplementary material for any papers I've been involved in. <br> 
  Where the data can be shared, I have included a link to the github repository. Otherwise, I did my best (at the time) to make something to demonstrate what the data looked like and the choices we made regarding the analysis.

  contents: 
     - "**/index.qmd"
     - "**/index.markdown" 
     - "**/index.md"
  sort: "date desc"
