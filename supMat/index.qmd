title: "Supplementary Materials"
description: | 
  This is where I have stored all the supplementary material for any papers I've been involved in. <br> 
  Where the data can be shared, I have included a link to the github repository. Otherwise, I did my best (at the time) to make something to demonstrate what the data looked like and the choices we made regarding the analysis.  
  
  Please note, this is a work in progress, I'm currently going back and updating my old supplementary materials to have a consistent style.
