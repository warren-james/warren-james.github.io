title: "Some things I wrote about things I find interesting"
description: |
  I've spent a lot of time working on various projects and ended up with many files. <br>
  This is where I save the nicest ones that I'll probably find useful at some point in the future. <br>
  For the most part, I've avoided getting on a soap box, but a little difference of opinion never hurt anyone.
